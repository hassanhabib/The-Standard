# 1 Brokers

## 1.0 Introduction
Brokers are a liaison between business logic and the outside world.
They are wrappers around external libraries, resources, services, or APIs to satisfy a local interface for the business to interact with them without having to be tightly coupled with any particular resources or external library implementation.

Brokers, in general, are meant to be disposable and replaceable - they are built with the understanding that technology evolves and changes all the time. Therefore,  at some point in the lifecycle of a given application, it will be replaced with a recent technology that gets the job done faster.

However, brokers also ensure that your business is pluggable by abstracting away any specific external resource dependencies from what your software is trying to accomplish.

For instance, you have an API built to consume and serve data from a SQL server. At some point, you decided that a better, more economical option for your API is to rely on a NoSQL technology instead. Having a broker to remove the dependency on SQL will make it much easier to integrate with NoSql with the least time and cost humanly possible.

## 1.1 On The Map
In any application, mobile, desktop, web, or simply an API, brokers usually reside at the "tail" of any app because they are the last point of contact between our custom code and the outside world.

Whether the outside world is simply local storage in memory or an independent system that resides behind an API, they all have to reside behind Brokers in any application.

In the following low-level architecture for a given API - Brokers reside between our business logic and the external resource:

    </p>

## 1.2 Characteristics
There are a few simple rules that govern the implementation of any broker - these rules are:

### 1.2.0 Implements a Local Interface
Brokers must satisfy a local contract and implement a local interface to allow decoupling between their implementation and the services that consume them.

For instance, given that we have a local contract, `IStorageBroker` that requires an implementation for any given CRUD operation for a local model `Student` - the contract operation would be as follows:

```csharp
public partial interface IStorageBroker
{
    ValueTask<IQueryable<Student>> SelectAllStudentsAsync();
}
```

An implementation for a storage broker would be as follows:

```csharp
public partial class StorageBroker
{
    private DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }

    public async ValueTask<IQueryable<Student>> SelectAllStudentsAsync() =>
        await SelectAllAsync<Student>();
}
```
A local contract implementation can be replaced at any point, from utilizing the Entity Framework as shown in the previous example to using a completely different technology like Dapper or an entirely different infrastructure like an Oracle or PostgreSQL database.

### 1.2.1 No Flow Control
Brokers should not have any form of flow control, such as if statements, while loops, or switch cases. That's because flow-control code is considered business logic, and it fits better in the services layer, where business logic should reside, not the brokers.

For instance, a broker method that retrieves a list of students from a database would look something like this:

```csharp
public async ValueTask<IQueryable<Student>> SelectAllStudentsAsync() =>
    await SelectAllAsync<Student>();
```
A simple function that calls the native EntityFramework `DbSet<T>` and returns a local model like `Student`. 


### 1.2.2 No Exception Handling
Exception handling is a form of flow control. Brokers are not supposed to handle exceptions but rather let them propagate to the broker-neighboring services, where they can be properly mapped and localized.


### 1.2.3 Own Their Configurations
Brokers are also required to handle their configurations - they may have a dependency injection from a configuration object to retrieve and set up the configurations for whichever external resource they are integrating.

For instance, connection strings in database communications are required to be retrieved and passed into the database client to establish a successful connection, as follows:

```csharp
public partial class StorageBroker : EFxceptionsContext, IStorageBroker
{
    private readonly IConfiguration configuration;

    public StorageBroker(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        this.configuration = configuration;
        this.Database.Migrate();
    }

    ...
    ...

    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseQueryTrackingBehavior(QueryTrackingBehavior.NoTracking);
        string connectionString = this.configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(connectionString);
    }
}
```

### 1.2.4 Natives from Primitives
Brokers may construct an external model object based on primitive types passed by broker-neighboring services.

For instance, in an e-mail notification broker, input parameters for a `.Send(...)` function require the basic input parameters such as the subject, content, or address. Here's an example:

```csharp
    public async ValueTask SendMailAsync(List<string> recipients, string subject, string content)
    {
        Message message = BuildMessage(recipients, ccRecipients, subject, content);
        await SendEmailMessageAsync(message);
    }
```

The primitive input parameters will ensure no strong dependencies between the broker-neighboring services and the external models.
Even in situations where the broker is simply a point of integration between your application and an external RESTful API, it's very highly recommended that you build your native models to reflect the same JSON object sent or returned from the API instead of relying on NuGet libraries, DLLs or shared projects to achieve the same goal.

### 1.2.5 Naming Conventions
The contracts for brokers shall remain as generic as possible to indicate their overall functionality; for instance, we say `IStorageBroker` instead of `ISqlStorageBroker` to indicate a particular technology or infrastructure.

With a single storage broker, it might be more convenient to maintain the same name as the contract. However, in the case of concrete implementations of brokers, it all depends on how many brokers you have that provide similar functionality. In our case, we have a concrete implementation of `IStorageBroker`, so the name would be `StorageBroker`.

However, if your application supports multiple queues, storage, or e-mail service providers, you might need to start specifying the overall target of the component; for instance, an `IQueueBroker` would have multiple implementations such as `NotificationQueueBroker` and `OrdersQueueBroker`.

However, if the concrete implementations target the same model and business logic, a diversion to the technology might be more beneficial. In this case, for instance, `IStorageBroker`, two different concrete implementations could be `SqlStorageBroker` and `MongoStorageBroker`. This case is typical in situations where the intention is to reduce production infrastructure costs.

### 1.2.6 Language
Brokers speak the language of the technologies they support.
For instance, in a storage broker, we say `SelectById` to match the SQL `Select` statement; in a queue broker, we say `Enqueue` to match the language.

If a broker supports an API endpoint, it shall follow the RESTFul semantics, such as `POST`, `GET`, or `PUT`. Here's an example:

```csharp

public async ValueTask<Student> PostStudentAsync(Student student) =>
    await this.PostAsync(RelativeUrl, student);

```

### 1.2.7 Up & Sideways
Brokers cannot call other brokers because they are the first point of abstraction and require no additional abstractions or dependencies other than a configuration access model.

Brokers also can't have services as dependencies, as the flow in any given system shall come from the services to the brokers and not the other way around.

For instance, even when a microservice has to subscribe to a queue, brokers will pass forward a listener method to process incoming events but not call the services that provide the processing logic.

The general rule here is that only services can call brokers, while brokers can only call external native dependencies.

### 1.2.8 One Resource, One Broker
Each Broker must represent exactly one resource. For example, if a system integrates with a SQL database, there should be a single Broker responsible for holding the configuration and managing all interactions with that database.
The reverse is also true: A Broker must never handle more than one resource and a single resource must only be managed by one Broker.

## 1.3 Organization
Brokers supporting multiple entities, such as Storage brokers, should leverage partial classes to break down the responsibilities per entity.

For instance, if we have a storage broker that provides all CRUD operations for both `Student` and `Teacher` models, then the organization of the files should be as follows:

- IStorageBroker.cs
  - IStorageBroker.Students.cs
  - IStorageBroker.Teachers.cs
- StorageBroker.cs
  - StorageBroker.Students.cs
  - StorageBroker.Teachers.cs

The primary purpose of this particular organization, leveraging partial classes, is to separate the concern for each entity to a finer level, which should make the maintainability of the software much higher.

Broker file and folder naming conventions strictly focus on the plurality of the entities they support and the singularity of the overall resource supported.

For instance, we say `IStorageBroker.Students.cs`. We also say `IEmailBroker` or `IQueueBroker.Notifications.cs` - singular for the resource and plural entities.

The same concept applies to the folders or namespaces containing these brokers.

For instance, we say:

```csharp
namespace OtripleS.Web.Api.Brokers.Storages
{
    ...
}
```

And we say:
```csharp
namespace OtripleS.Web.Api.Brokers.Queues
{
    ...
}
```

## 1.4 Broker Types
In most applications built today, some common Brokers are usually needed to get an enterprise application up and running - some of these are Storage, Time, APIs, Logging, and Queues.

Some brokers interact with existing system resources, such as *time*, to allow broker-neighboring services to treat time as a dependency and control how a particular service would behave based on the value of *time* at any point in the past, present, or future.

### 1.4.0 Entity Brokers
Entity brokers provide integration points with the system's external resources to fulfill business requirements.

For instance, entity brokers integrate with storage, providing capabilities to store or retrieve records from a database.

Entity brokers are also like queue brokers, providing a point of integration to push messages to a queue for other services to consume and process to fulfill their business logic.

Broker-neighboring services can only call entity brokers because they require a level of validation on the data they receive or provide before proceeding.

### 1.4.1 Support Brokers
Support brokers are general-purpose brokers. They provide the functionality to support services, but they have no characteristics that make them different from any other system.

An excellent example of a support broker is the `DateTimeBroker`, a broker specifically designed to abstract away the business layer's strong dependency on the system date time.

Time brokers don't target any specific entity; they are almost the same across many systems.

Another example of support brokers is the `LoggingBroker` - they provide data to logging and monitoring systems to enable the system's engineers to visualize the overall flow of data across the system and be notified in case any issues occur.

Support Brokers may be called across the entire business layer: foundation, processing, orchestration, coordination, management, or aggregation services, unlike Entity Brokers. Logging brokers are required as a supporting component in the system to provide all the capabilities needed for services to log their errors, calculate a date, or perform any other supporting functionality.

You can find real-world examples of brokers in the OtripleS project [here](https://github.com/hassanhabib/OtripleS/tree/master/OtripleS.Web.Api/Brokers).

## 1.5 Implementation
Here's a real-life implementation of an entire storage broker for all CRUD operations for `Student` entity:

## 1.5.1 Asynchronization Abstraction

This approach encourages a consistent handling of asynchronous operations across all method implementations, promoting a clean and efficient abstraction that aligns with Standard principles.

        {

## 1.6 Summary
Brokers are the first layer of abstraction between your business logic and the outside world. But they are not the only layer of abstraction because a few native models will still leak through your brokers to your broker-neighboring services. It is natural to avoid doing any mappings outside the realm of logic, in our case, the foundation services.

For instance, in a storage broker, regardless of the ORM used, some native exceptions from your ORM (EntityFramework, for example) will occur, such as `DbUpdateException` or `SqlException`. In that case, we need another layer of abstraction to act as a mapper between these exceptions and our core logic to convert them into local exception models. 

This responsibility lies in the hands of the broker-neighboring services. I also call them foundation services; these services are the last point of abstraction before your core logic, which consists of local models and contracts.


## 1.7 FAQs
Over time, some common questions arose from the engineers I worked with throughout my career. Since some of these questions reoccurred on several occasions, it might be helpful to aggregate them here so everyone can learn about other perspectives on brokers.

### 1.7.0 Is the Brokers Pattern the same as the Repository Pattern?
From an operational standpoint, brokers seem to be more generic than repositories.

Repositories usually target storage-like operations, mainly towards databases. However, brokers can be an integration point for any external dependency, such as e-mail services, queues, and other APIs.

A more similar pattern for brokers is the Unit of Work pattern. It mainly focuses on the overall operation without having to tie the definition or the name with any particular operation.

In general, all these patterns try to implement the same SOLID principles: separation of concern, dependency injection, and single responsibility.

But because SOLID are principles and not exact guidelines, it's expected to see all different implementations and patterns to achieve that principle.

### 1.7.1 Why can't the brokers implement a contract for methods that return an interface instead of a concrete model?
That would be an ideal situation, but that would also require brokers to do a conversion or mapping between the native models returned from the external resource SDKs or APIs and the internal model that adheres to the local contract.

Doing that on the broker level will require introducing business logic into that realm, which is outside the purpose of that component.

We define business logic code as any intended sequential, selective, or iteration code. Brokers are not unit-tested because they lack business logic. They may be part of an acceptance or integration test but certainly not part of unit-level tests simply because they do not contain business logic.

### 1.7.2 If brokers were a layer of abstraction from the business logic, why do we allow external exceptions to leak through them onto the services layer?
Brokers are only the *first* layer of abstraction, but not the only one. Broker-neighboring services are responsible for converting the native exceptions occurring in a broker into a more local exception model that can be handled and processed internally within the business logic realm.

Business logic emerges in the processing, orchestration, coordination, and aggregation layers, where all the exceptions, returned models, and operations are local to the system.

### 1.7.3 Why do we use partial classes for brokers who handle multiple entities?
Since brokers must own their configurations, it makes more sense to partialize when possible to avoid reconfiguring every storage broker for each entity.

Partial classes are a feature in the C# language, but it should be possible to implement the same behavior through inheritance in other programming languages.

### 1.7.4 Are brokers the same as providers (Provider Pattern)?
No. Providers blur the line between services (business logic) and brokers (integration layer). Brokers target particular disposable components within the system, but providers include more than just that.

### 1.7.5 Why is ValueTask preferred over Task in the implementations outlined in this section?
ValueTask is a struct that is used to represent a task that returns a value.
It is a value-based representation of a task that can be used to avoid allocations in the case where a task completes synchronously.

In order to abstract at an operational level, all example implementations in this section utilize the ValueTask type to provide an asynchronization abstraction.
This approach encourages a consistent handling of asynchronous operations across all method implementations, promoting a clean and efficient abstraction that aligns with the Standard principles.
By using ValueTask, we reduce memory allocations in scenarios where the result is often available immediately, thereby enhancing performance while maintaining code clarity.

### 1.7.6 Why does or how can I suppress warnings thrown in my code files?
Warnings are thrown by the compiler to alert you of potential issues in your code. It is important to address these warnings to ensure that your code is clean and free of potential bugs.
Engineers and developers can resolve warnings by following the suggestions provided by the compiler. This may involve making changes to the code, refactoring, or updating dependencies.

It is important to regularly review and address warnings in your code to maintain code quality and ensure that your application runs smoothly.

Here is one way to resolve warnings in your code:
To suppress a warning given by the IDE or compiler, you can configure your .csproj file using the <NoWarn> element.
This approach allows you to disable specific warnings globally across your project.

For example, adding <NoWarn>CS1998</NoWarn> to a <PropertyGroup> in your .csproj file will suppress the warning CS1998, which indicates an asynchronous method lacking await operators. If you need to suppress multiple warnings, you can list them separated by commas. This method provides a clean and consistent way to manage warnings without scattering #pragma warning directives throughout your code.
```csharp
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

	<PropertyGroup>
		<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
		<Nullable>disable</Nullable>
		<ImplicitUsings>disable</ImplicitUsings>
        <WarningLevel>CS1998</WarningLevel>
	</PropertyGroup>
    ...
```
