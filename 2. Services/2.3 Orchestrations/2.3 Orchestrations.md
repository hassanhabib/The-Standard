# 2.3 Orchestration Services (Complex Higher Order Logic)

## 2.3.0 Introduction

Orchestration services are the combinators between multiple foundation or processing services to perform a complex logical operation. Orchestrations main responsibility is to do a multi-entity logical operation and delegate the dependencies of said operation to downstream processing or foundation services.
Orchestration services main responsibility is to encapsulate operations that require two or three business entities.

```csharp
public async ValueTask<LibraryCard> CreateStudentLibraryCardAsync(LibraryCard libraryCard) =>
TryCatch(async () =>
{
    ValidateLibraryCard(libraryCard);

    await this.studentProcessingService
        .VerifyEnrolledStudentExistsAsync(libraryCard.StudentId);

    return await this.libraryCardProcessingService.CreateLibraryCardAsync(libraryCard);
});

```

In the above example, the `LibraryCardOrchestrationService` calls both the `StudentProcessingService` and `LibraryCardProcessingService` to perform a complex operation. First, verify the student we are creating a library card for does exist and that they are enrolled. Then second create the library card.

The operation of creating a library card for any given student cannot be performed by simply calling the library card service. That's because the library card service (processing or foundation) does not have access to all the details about the student. Therefore a combination logic here needed to be implemented to ensure a proper flow is in place.

Its important to understand that orchestration services are only required if and only if we need to combine multiple entities operations primitive or higher-order. In some architectures, orchestration services might not even exist. That's simply because some microservices might be simply responsible for applying validation logic and persisting and retrieving data from storage, no more or no less.

## 2.3.1 On The Map

Orchestration services are one of the core business logic components in any system. They are positioned between single entity services (such as processing or foundation) and advanced logic services such as coordination services, aggregation services or just simply exposers such as controllers, web components or anything else. Here's a high level overview of where orchestration services may live:

    </p>
<br />

As shown above, orchestration services have quite a few dependencies and consumers. They are the core engine of any software. On the right hand side, you can see the dependencies an orchestration service may have. Since a processing service is optional based on whether a higher-order business logic is needed or not - orchestration services can combine multiple foundation services as well.

The existence of an orchestration service warrants the existence of a processing service. But thats not always the case. There are situations where all orchestration services need to finalize a business flow is to interact with primitive-level functionality.

From a consumer standpoint however, orchestration service could have several consumers. These consumers could range from coordination services (orchestrators of orchestrators) or aggregation services or simply an exposer. Exposers are like controllers, view service, UI components or simply another foundation or processing service in case of putting messages back on a queue - which we will discuss further in our Standard.

## 2.3.2 Characteristics

In general, orchestration services are concerned with combining single-entity primitive or higher-order business logic operations to execute a successful flow. But you can also think of them as the glue that ties multiple single-entity operations together.

### 2.3.2.0 Language

Just like processing services, the language used in orchestration services define the level of complexity and the capabilities it offers.
Usually, orchestration services combine two or more primitive or higher-order operations from multiple single-entity services to execute a successful operation.

#### 2.3.2.0.0 Functions Language

Orchestration services have a very common charateristic when it comes to the language of it's functions. Orchestration services are wholistic in most of the language of its function, you will see functions such as `NotifyAllAdmins` where the service pulls all users with admin type and then calls a notification service to notify each and every one of them.

It becomes very obvious that orchestration services offer functionality that inches closer and closer to a business language than perimitive technical operation. You may see almost an identical expression in a non-technical business requirement that matches one for one a function name in an orchestration service. The same pattern continues as one goes to higher and more advanced categories of services within that realm of business logic.

#### 2.3.2.0.1 Pass-Through

Orchestration services can also be a pass-through for some operations. For instance, an orchestration service could allow an `AddStudentAsync` to be propagated through the service to unify the source of interactions with the system at the exposers level. In which case, orchestration services will use the very same terminology a processing or a foundation service may use to propagate the operation.

#### 2.3.2.0.2 Class-Level Language

Orchestration services mainly combine multiple operations to support a particular entity. So, if the main entity of support is `Student` and the rest of the entities are just to support an operation mainly targetting a `Student` entity - then the name of the orchestration service would be `StudentOrchestrationService`.

This level of enforcement of naming conventions ensures that any orchestration service is staying focused on a single entity responsibility with respect to multiple other supporting entities.

For instance, if creating a library card requires ensuring the student referenced in that library card must be enrolled in a school. Then an orchestration service will then be named after it's main entity which is `LibraryCard` in this case. Our orchestration service name then would be `LibraryCardOrchestrationService`.

The opposite is also true. If enrolling a student in a school has an accompanying operations such as creating a library card, then in this case a `StudentOrchestrationService` must be created with the main purpose to create a `Student` and then all other related entities once the aforementioned succeeds.

The same idea applies to all exceptions created in an orchestration service such as `StudentOrchestrationValidationException` and `StudentOrchestrationDependencyException` and so on.

### 2.3.2.1 Dependencies

As we mentioned above, orchestration services might have a bit larger range of types of dependencies unlike processing and foundation services. This is only due the optionality of processing services. Therefore, orchestration services may have dependencies that range from foundation services or processing services and optionally and usually logging or any other utility brokers.

#### 2.3.2.1.0 Dependency Balance (Florance Pattern)

There's a very important rule that govern the consistency and balance of orchestration services which is the 'Florance Pattern'. the rule dictates that any orchestration service may not combine dependencies from different categories of operation.

What that means, is that an orchestration service cannot have a foundation and a processing services combined together. The dependencies has to be either all processings or all foundations. That rule doesn't apply to utility brokers dependencies however.

Here's an example of an unbalanced orchestration service dependencies:

<br />
    <p align="center" >
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1453985/118415856-9e5e5f80-b661-11eb-96db-a541f89ccee7.png" />
    </p>
<br />

An additional processing service is required to give a pass-through to a lower-level foundation service to balance the architecture - applying 'Florance Pattern' for symmetry would turn our architecture to the following:

<br />
    <p align="center" >
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1453985/118415965-33f9ef00-b662-11eb-8538-59e5c728d308.png" />
    </p>
<br />

Applying 'Florance Pattern' might be very costly at the beginning as it includes creating an entirely new processing service (or multiple) just to balance the architecture. But its benefits outweighs the effort spent from a maintainability, readability and pluggability perspectives.

#### 2.3.2.1.1 Two-Three

The 'Two-Three' rule is a complexity control rule. This rule dictates that an orchestration service may not have more than three or less than two processing or foundation services to run the orchestration. This rule, however, doesn't apply to utility brokers. And orchestration service may have a `DateTimeBroker` or a `LoggingBroker` without any issues. But an orchestration service may not have an entity broker, such as a `StorageBroker` or a `QueueBroker` which feeds directly into the core business layer of any service.

The 'Two-Three' rule may require a layer of normalization to the categorical business function that is required to be accomplished. Let's talk about the different mechanisms of normalizing orchestration services.

##### 2.3.2.1.1.0 Full-Normalization

Often times, there are situations where the current architecture of any given orchestration service ends up with one orchestration service that has three dependencies. And a new entity processing or foundation service is required to complete an existing process.

For instance, let's say we have a `StudentContactOrchestrationService` and that service has dependencies that provide primitive-level functionality for `Address`, `Email` and `Phone` for each student. Here's a visualization of that state:

<br />
    <p align=center>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1453985/120101834-f636a500-c0fc-11eb-968b-10ed9a60bac8.png" />
    </p>
<br />

Now, a new requirment comes in to add a student `SocialMedia` to gather more contact information about how to reach a certain student. We can go into full-normalization mode simply by finding the common ground that equally splits the contact information entities. For instance, we can split regular contact information versus digital contact information as in `Address` and `Phone` versus `Email` and `SocialMedia`. this way we split four dependencies into two each for their own orchestration services as follows:

<br />
    <p align=center>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1453985/120101983-c6d46800-c0fd-11eb-836a-496d191ef922.png" />
    </p>
<br />

As you can see in the figure above, we modified the existing `StudentContactOrchestrationService` into `StudentRegularContactOrchestrationService`, then we removed one of it's dependencies on the `EmailService`.

Additionally, we created a new `StudentDigitalContactOrchestrationService` to have two dependencies on the existing `EmailService` in addition to the new `SocialMediaService`. But now that the normalization is over, we need an advanced order business logic layer, like a coordination service to provide student contact information to upstream consumers.

##### 2.3.2.1.1.1 Semi-Normalization

Normalization isn't always as straightforward as the example above. Especially in situations where a core entity has to exist before creating or writing in additional information towards related entities to that very entity.

For instance, let's say we have a `StudentRegistrationOrchestrationService` which relies on `StudentProcessingService`, `LibraryCardProcessingService` and `BookProcessingService` as follows:

<br />
    <p align=center>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1453985/120099527-c41f4600-c0f0-11eb-8702-1439f966d9dc.png" />
    </p>
<br />

But now, we need a new service to handle students immunization records as `ImmunizationProcessingService`. We need all four services but we already have a `StudentRegistrationOrchestrationService` that has three dependencies. At this point a semi-normalization is required for the re-balancing of the architecture to honor the 'Two-Three' rule and eventually to control the complexity.

<br />
    <p align=center>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1453985/120100296-ea46e500-c0f4-11eb-888a-ed6668e9ffdb.png" />
    </p>
<br />

In this case here, a further normalization or a split is required to re-balance the architecture. We need to think conceptually about a common ground between the primitive entities in a student registration process. A student requirements contain identity, health and materials. We can, in this scenario combine `LibraryCard` and `Book` under the same orchestration service as books and libraries are somewhat related. So we have `StudentLibraryOrchestrationService` and for the other service we would have `StudentHealthOrchestrationService`. as follows:

 <br />
    <p align=center>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1453985/120100597-68f05200-c0f6-11eb-9ccc-ae1c963f6de5.png" />
    </p>
 <br />

To complete the registration flow with a new model, a coordination service is required to pass-in an advanced business logic to combine all of these entities together. But more importantly, you will notice that each orchestration service now has a redundant dependency of `StudentProcessingService` to ensure no virtual dependency on any other orchestration service create or ensuring a student record exists.

Virtual dependencies are very tricky. it's a hidden connection between two services of any category where one service implicitly assumes that a particular entity will be created and present. Virtual dependencies are very dangerous and threaten the true autonomy of any service. Detecting virutal dependencies at early stage in the design and development process could be a daunting but necessary task to ensure a clean Standardized architecture is in place.

Just like model changes as it may require migrations, and additional logic and validations, a new requirement for an entirely new additional entity might require a restructuring of an existing architecture or extending it to a new version, depending in which stage the system is receiving these new requirements.

It may be very enticing to just add an additional dependency to an existing orchestration service - but that's where the system starts to diverge from 'The Standard'. And that's when the system starts off the road of being an unmaintainable legacy system. But more importantly, it's when the engineers envovled in designing and developing the system are challenged against their very principles and craftmanship.

##### 2.3.2.1.1.2 No-Normalization

There are scenarios where any level of normalization is a challenge to achieve. While I believe that everything, everywhere, somehow is connected. Sometimes it might be incomprehensible for the mind to group multiple services together under one orchestration service.

Because it's quite hard for my mind to come up with an example for multiple entities that have no connection to each other, as I truly believe it couldn't exist. I'm going to rely on some fictional entities to visualize a problem. So let's assume there are `AService` and `BService` orchestrated together with an `XService`. The existence of `XService` is important to ensure that both `A` and `B` can be created with an ensurance that a core entity `X` does exist.

Now, let's say a new service `CService` is required to be added to the mix to complete the existing flow. So, now we have four different dependencies under one orchestration service, and a split is mandatory. Since there's no relationship whatsoever between `A`, `B` and `C`, a 'No-Normalization' approach becomes the only option to realize a new design as follows:

 <br />
    <p align=center>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1453985/120102975-4d8b4400-c102-11eb-9582-6f95d17227e7.png" />
    </p>
 <br />

Each one of the above primitive services will be orchestrated with a core service `X` then gathered again under a coordination service. This case above is the worst case scenario, where a normalization of any size is impossible. Note, that the author of this Standard couldn't come up with a realistic example unlike any others to show you how rare it is to run into that situation, so let's a 'No-Normalization' approach be your very last solution if you truly run out of options.

##### 2.3.2.1.1.3 Meaningful Breakdown
Regardless of the type of normalization that you will need to follow. You have to make sure that your grouped services represent a common meaning. For instance, putting together a `StudentProcessingService` and `LibraryProcessingService` must require a commonality in function between the two. A good example of that would be `StudentRegisterationOrchestrationService` for instance. The registeration process requires adding a new student record and creating a library card for that very same student.

Implementing orchestration services without intersection between two or three entities per operation defeats the whole purpose of having an orchestration service. This condition is satisfied if at least one intersection between two entities has occurred. An orchestration service may then have other operations that we call 'Pass-Through' where we propagate certain routines from their processing or foundation origins if they match the same contract.

Here's an example:

```csharp
public class StudentOrchestrationService
{
    public async ValueTask<Student> RegisterStudentAsync(Student student)
    {
        Student addedStudent =
            await this.studentProcessingService.AddStudentAsync(student);
    
        LibraryCard libraryCard = 
            await this.libraryCardPorcessingService.AddLibraryCardAsync(
                addedStudent.Id);

        return addedStudent;
    }


    public async ValueTask<Student> ModifyStudentAsync(Student student) =>
        await this.studentProcessingService.ModifyStudentAsync(student);
}
```

In the example above, our `StudentOrchestrationService` had an orchestration routine where it combined adding a student and creating a library card for that very same student. But additionally it also offers a 'Pass-Through' function for a low-level processing service routine to modify a student.

'Pass-Through' routines must have the exact same contract as the rest of all other routines in any orchestration service. That's our 'Pure Contract' principle which dictates that any service should allow the very same contract as input and output or primitive types.
